- These lists are called 'Krates', and can be shared and interacted with much like any other social media post.

- 'To listen' list, for those albums that would be better listened to later on.

## Inspiration: 
- I really enjoy collecting, organizing and archiving my watch history on Letterboxd, and i was upset there was nothing similar in the space of music. So, i decided to solve that problem for myself, and create an efficient digital platform to my liking.

## Future Plans: 
- I plan to release the app on the app store when i am done developing it to gain experience with deploying an app. Also, creating marketing plans to try to get more users. Im also interested in solving the problems that may appear in the face of scalability.
